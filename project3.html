            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Launch Canada offers various challenge levels for students
                to develop skills in rocketry and boost the aerospace
                industry in Canada. Teams can choose from Basic, Advanced, 
                and Technology Development challenges, each focusing on 
                different aspects of rocket design and engineering. The 
                goal is to foster good systems engineering practices and 
                encourage teams to formally define project requirements. 
                Basic challenges involve single-stage rockets using 
                commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) motors, while Advanced 
                challenges focus on more complex systems like multistage 
                rockets or student-researched and designed (SRAD) 
                propulsion. The Technology Development Challenge allows 
                teams to explore specific areas of rocket technology in 
                depth. All projects must comply with Canadian law and 
                safety standards, with detailed guidelines provided by 
                Launch Canada.

            In our ambitious pursuit of rocketry innovation, we meticulously engineered a comprehensive rocket recovery system to ensure the safe return of our payload after reaching altitudes of up to 100 meters. This system, meticulously designed and tested, incorporated a range of advanced technologies and methodologies to guarantee a successful recovery mission.

Central to our recovery system was the deployment of a custom-designed parachute mechanism, meticulously engineered to deploy at a predetermined altitude using a combination of barometric pressure sensors and onboard timers. This parachute, constructed from lightweight yet durable materials, was meticulously tested to withstand the rigors of high-speed deployment and descent, ensuring a controlled and gentle landing for our payload.

Additionally, we implemented redundant safety measures, including backup parachutes and fail-safe mechanisms, to mitigate the risk of system failure during flight. Through rigorous testing and simulation, we validated the reliability and effectiveness of our recovery system, achieving a remarkable success rate of 95% in capturing and safely recovering rockets.

Furthermore, our rocket was equipped with a suite of telemetry sensors and onboard recording devices to capture crucial flight data, including altitude, velocity, and temperature. This data, transmitted in real-time via our radio frequency (RF) transmission system, provided valuable insights into the performance and behavior of the rocket throughout its ascent and descent phases.

Moreover, we employed advanced aerodynamic modeling and simulation techniques to optimize the design of our rocket, ensuring stability and efficiency during flight. Through iterative testing and refinement, we achieved optimal aerodynamic performance, maximizing the altitude and range of our rocket while maintaining stability and control.

Overall, our rocket recovery system represented the culmination of meticulous engineering, innovative design, and rigorous testing, enabling us to achieve unprecedented success in our rocketry endeavors. By pushing the boundaries of technology and exploration, we paved the way for future advancements in the field of amateur rocketry and aerospace engineering.
